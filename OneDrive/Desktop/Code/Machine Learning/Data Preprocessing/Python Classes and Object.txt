A Class is the model or blue print or something we want to 
build. An object is an istance of the class.

A house (object) that was build by following the instruction
of the construction plan (class).

A method is a tool we can use on the object to complete 
a specific action. A method can also be seen as a function
that is applied onto the object. Takes some input (class) and returns 
some output.
